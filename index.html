                                    What sets this course apart is its flexibility - with 16 optional modules to choose from in years 2 and 3. It is ideal if you are looking for a wide range of computing skills: from web design and development with PHP and JavaScript, computer programming in languages such as C# and Python, mobile app coding in Java, and embedded systems with C++. You will develop skills in cyber security, database management and CISCO network systems support, and have the option to study specialised subjects such as AI with Machine Learning and Big Data. We will help you develop a systematic, creative and flexible approach to problem solving that computing professionals rely on.</br></br>
                                    The course is designed with modules to promote your professional growth and personal development. You will be encouraged to acquire key practical skills to help you build a broad base and deep knowledge of computing. This will allow you to make informed choices when developing specialist in-depth knowledge in your preferred areas.</br></br>                            
                                    Employability is a key focus with guest speakers from industry, practical case studies, vocational assignment scenarios and modules which have been developed alongside employers. We encourage entrepreneurs and will provide you with the opportunity to gain the knowledge necessary to develop your own business ideas around the latest technical innovations. Students also take part in the Global Day of Code and Agile Peterborough events, along with regular sessions for meeting professionals and build working relationships.</br></br>
                                    The Major Project is your chance to develop expertise in a subject of your choice, which can form the centre-piece for your portfolio ready for future interviews. You will have the opportunity to demonstrate this work to industry professionals at our annual exhibition of final year projects. Examples of previous projects include VR computer games, specialised applications of Drones and Raspberry Pi based systems such as digital weather stations and in-car diagnostic dashboards.</br></br>
                                    The courses at University Centre Peterborough are studied in smaller class sizes compared with other universities, a typical class size is under 30 students.

                                    <h4><b>ACCREDITATION OF PRIOR CERTIFICATED LEARNING (APCL) FOR ENTRY</b></h4>        
                                    APCL relates to learning completed through an earlier course of study. If you have previously completed a course which is relevant to your proposed course you should make this clear when you apply. For this to be eligible for consideration you must be able to provide certification, which shows your success in a final assessment for that course. Learning must be completed in the last five years or further evidence of updating will be required. Simple participation in a course or an attendance certificate is not sufficient.</br></br>        
                                    <h4><b>EXEMPTIONS BASED ON ACCREDITATION OF PRIOR LEARNING (APL)</b></h4>        
                                    We offer students flexibility in their studies, by recognising learning they may have completed elsewhere before they apply. The Accreditation of Prior Learning process ensures that we can take this into account when determining the modules you must study. It is important that you identify any relevant prior learning when you apply. If your previous study specifically relates to modules on the course you wish to undertake we may approve a reduced programme of study, thus shortening the time it takes to obtain your award. Where this relates to learning completed through an earlier course of study, this is called Prior Certificated Learning, and where learning has been achieved through relevant work or experience, this is referred to as Prior Experiential Learning. Claims must be approved before you commence a course.</br></br>        
                                    <h4><b>EXEMPTIONS BASED ON ACCREDITATION OF PRIOR EXPERIENTIAL CERTIFICATED LEARNING (APEL)</b></h4>        
                                    It is important to understand that the APEL process does not award academic credit for experience alone, but for learning which can be shown to have been achieved through that experience. Students are required to prepare an individual case for the credit arising from their learning experiences. This normally means that a student receives support in the preparation of a portfolio, which evidences their claimed exemptions for entry. This portfolio of evidence is then submitted for assessment and the possible award of academic credit. Alternative methods of assessment of evidence may be available but needs to be discussed with the Admissions team or Course Leader.

                                    When studying this course at University Centre Peterborough, we will timetable your lectures as two full days a week over two semesters per year (part-time will be one to two full days a week over two semesters per year).</br></br>
                                    We are able to offer this convenient timetabling to our students as we are a smaller institution so we can timetable our staff and resources more efficiently.</br></br>   
                                    Over the duration of your course, teaching will be delivered by the following methods:</br></br>

                                    There are two semesters per year and each semester is up to 15 weeks which includes up to 12 teaching weeks and 3 assessment weeks.</br></br>
                                    If studying full-time you will be in classes, seminars and tutorials for approximately 15 hours per week and will spend the rest of your time in independent study and extra-curricular activities including work placement if not embedded in your course. We recommend that full-time students allow an additional 30 hours per week for additional study.</br></br>
                                    The campus is open Monday to Friday throughout the whole year and open until 9pm from Monday to Thursday during term time. You will also have 24/7 access to a virtual learning environment (VLE) with e-books, journals and abstracts plus teaching resources and interactive tools.</br></br>
                                    Timetables are available at least one month before registration and you can refer to the <a href = "https://www.ucp.ac.uk/key-dates/">academic calendar</a> for examination weeks and resit periods.</br></br>
                                    The days of the week you study may change each year and in some circumstances one of the full days might have to be split into two half days, but we aim to keep these as full days where possible.

                                    We will provide, by the beginning of the first week of each semester, a current module guide with all the information you need for each module, including details of assessment tasks, the deadlines for these tasks, the required format and any relevant guidance.</br></br>                
                                    Formative assessment opportunities are written into all module plans to provide students with on-going feedback. End of semester assessments will have formative opportunities in weeks 9 or 10 of the semester. In addition revision sessions will be held in week 12.</br></br>                
                                    Your final degree classification is calculated as an average of your highest 60 credits at Level 5 and all credits at Level 6.</br></br>

                                    As the course is timetabled as full days during the week when studied full-time, this also gives you the flexibility to find a work placement, internship or volunteering opportunity which will improve your employability after you graduate. All students are encouraged to identify work experience to aid their career development.

                                    I am the Course Leader for the FdSc and BSc (Hons) Computing & Information Systems degrees at University Centre Peterborough. I have been teaching computing related subjects since January 2007 and have been teaching at University Centre Peterborough since September 2009 on modules including Programming Concepts, Digital Asset Development and Developing Interactive Web Solutions.<br><br>
                
                                    I have held industry positions as a Software Developer producing bespoke systems for the supply chain industry, working to develop custom solutions for various departments. From 2003 to 2007, I worked as a Database Administrator which involved migrating legacy systems from Microsoft Access to an SQL Server platform and further developing the system as business needs changed.<br><br>
                                    
                                    I have also worked in the Canadian media industry as an Animator and Film Editor on various projects for television and independent films. During this period, I worked with NISH media to animate and combine live action footage with computer animations for children’s television shows. I also produced animated 3D models for complex movie previsualisations.<br><br>
                                    
                                    I am interested in Video Game Design and Development, having produced a number of independent games over that last 15 years and winning an award for Educational Video Game Design in 2010. More recently my focus has been on developing the Computing and Information Systems degree, working with the local computing industry to meet their needs and to modernise delivery with wider industry practices, ensuring graduates have the skills that are widely sought after.<br><br>
